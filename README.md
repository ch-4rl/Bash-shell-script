# Bash-shell-script
Developed a script to resolve domain names into their IP addresses. It can process a text file with domain names provided as a command-line argument, displaying the IP addresses for each domain. The script allows users to input domain names to resolve or quit the program if no file is provided. It provides meaningful feedback and processes multiple domains efficiently.
